To start tests a TA should go to the catalogue page first when they go to the StuffGo url. Initially, all the items are displayed. However, they can also perform some refined item search by category, type, and brand. When the TA selects an item, they are redirected to the specific item info page. On the item info page, the TA can find any information about the selected item, i.e. price, rating, reviews and description. The item page offers a rating or review system. If the TA wishes to add feedback about a particular item, first, they have to log in and they should purchase the item. To buy an item, the TA can add the selected item to the cart without the need to login. After all the items have been added to the cart, the TA can view the cart page where they can also increase or decrease the quantity of the items before going to the checkout page. If the TA is not logged in, the checkout page will redirect the TA to the login page to verify their billing and shipping address or to provide that information on the registration page. Once the TA decides to buy the items, they can press the submit order button and be redirected to the catalogue page.To access the analytics page the TA should click or type the analytics Url provided and login as an admin. After that on the dashboard they should be able to get reposts by clicking buttons.
